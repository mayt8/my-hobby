<h1>Soccer</h1>

<h2>ECNL Soccer</h2>
<p>
 I play soccer for <a href="http://www.carolinaelitesc.com/">CESA</a> 01 ECNL. I play center forward and center mid. I have practice three times a week and games most weekends.
 My team has to travel for games a lot. </p>

<p>
My team colors are black and white. Our home fields are called MESA. We are one of the only <a href="http://www.eliteclubsnationalleague.com/">ECNL</a> clubs in South Carolina. ECNL 
is the highest level of club soccer for girls our age. </p>

<p>
For my age group we play with 22 players on the field. 11 on one team and 11 on the other team. Younger teams play with 16.
8 on one team and 8 on the other. The youngest teams play with 12 players. 6 on one team and 6 on the other.

<h2>The Rules</h2>
<p>
The rules for soccer are pretty simple. If you are behind the last defender in their half then you are offsides. You can not touch the 
ball with your hands unless you are the goalie. If you push or kick someone you get a foul called on you. If you foul too many
times then you get a yellow card. After you get a yellow card if you keep fouling you get a red card. A yellow card is like 
a warning, but a red card means that you can not finish playing the game and you have to sit out of the next few games.
